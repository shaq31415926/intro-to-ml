       "[\"i was born in akureyri, iceland, but moved to reykjavk while i was still a baby. i gravitated towards art from an early age, but it wasn't until recently that i decided to pursue it with earnestness. i moved to san francisco to study art about two years ago and i love it so far.  i enjoy walking along the embarcadero, going to art galleries, playing video- and board games, watching movies, reading books, and having a good, stimulating conversation over a drink or two.\",\n",
       " 'i never really fit any stereotypes growing up and i think that allowed me to get along with many different types of people- from a variety of ages, socio-economic backgrounds, ethnicity, etc. i consider myself more empathetic than most and practice the \\'golden rule\\' with strangers and acquaintances.  i value street smarts and spirituality/wisdom over book smarts. i\\'d like to think i consider the \"big-picture\" a lot when it comes to making life decisions.  i think on the outside i probably look nerdy, skinny/asian/glasses (i\\'m multi-racial) but my personality/voice/presence can be quite loud and pugnacious at times. i also love almost all sports- played tennis/soccer growing up (still play soccer regularly, would like to play tennis consistently again) and enjoy watching most sports (soccer, tennis, giants, 49ers, sj sharks fan). but i also am heavily influenced/appreciative of visual arts and music- i enjoy museums, concerts (hip hop to classical and jazz) galleries, etc. i also have nerdy tendencies: i\\'ve loved video games (i haven\\'t played anything for a few years intentionally due to a lack of self control and needing to concentrate on my career) and anime for a long time, most cartoons for that matter.  i\\'m close to my family, who fortunately all live locally, and they are a big part of my life.  i\\'ve reached a great point in my life and am pretty content. i\\'ve had my share of ups/downs growing up, but i\\'ve worked through a lot of the problems and consider myself emotionally healthy/mature and generally even keel. i eat well, exercise and my business is growing... but being self employed keeps me home a lot, which is where you come in :) i definitely need to socialize more and make new friends.  if that certain level of emotional intimacy is achieved, i\\'m very playful, goofy, talk in strange/funny voices and will randomly burst into song.. haha',\n",
       " \"my personality:  i am rather independent; at the same time i enjoy more than anything to be surrounded with family and friends, who mean a world to me.  when i meet people, i am somewhat shy at first, but once the conversation gets going i click with people easily, i am very laid back and have a good sense of humor, which is a good basis for conversation starter.  it takes me a while to really warm up, but once i do, i become a loyal and caring friend, who has got your back.  what i do for living:  i do what i love and love what i do ... i'm in finance field and am good with math. i love challenging projects and sometimes get carried away with working long hours (that's probably why i ended up on ok cupid in a first place)  things i love doing:  i love exploring and learning new things, as a result i travel a lot (some of the trips were completely spontaneous, just picking a destination and booking a flight). i think these experiences enrich me as a person and give me a different perspective at life / important values in life.  i love sports  i used to be a full-time runner, but now trying to take it easier on my joints by alternating it with yoga.  finding new venues / galleries / artists around the city (and willing to explore). i can easily go watch a ballet performance at performing arts center one night and hang out with my friends at public works the night after.  cheers, 5303187  ps. its not my phone number and it does not have an encrypted meaning :)\",\n",

(this is negotiable though, perhaps...depends on how secure i feel with you)  i am looking for someone who is able to deeply commit, be vulnerable, be best of friends, share an *amazing* life together, while having this sort of dynamic at times. sex is only one dimension of a fantastic relationship, right? and my kinks are something i like *on occasion*. otherwise i'm like most women, i enjoy things sweet and connected. but i do want to be able to experiment once we have a connection and we trust one another.  i want to create a life with someone. create an amazing home together. travel the world. be good people, be in service to society. be peaceful, involved in life. i'm an artist. i'm very passionate. i am also a very spiritual person (i study taoism and healing)  i am considered very attractive by most peoples standards. i am caucasian, canadian, 5'7 tall with hourglass curves. very feminine frame. small waist with booty :p mysterious. smiles a lot. very nurturing with those i love. old school values of treating people well, caring for people. a humanitarian. sensitive and intuitive. somewhat sarcastic. stylish.  i'm self employed, make my own schedule (and can travel at the drop of a dime) i'm an animal lover, and i love spending time in nature too. camping, hiking, snorkeling are all top on my list. i'd love to learn how to dive or kite surf.  travel, new technologies, smart and forward thinking people, kind, loving, gentle people, these things i adore. i come from a great family and we are all super close. pretty rare these days.  i've studied with shaman, rode horses, motorcycles, and roller coasters locally and abroad. i'm hip without being obnoxious or apathetic i have a few tattoos, i've definitely enjoyed a lot of music, festivals, concerts but these days i'm happiest going to an art show, (and try to go to art basel/ miami every year) having dinner with friends, spending a night in making art, or road tripping. i love the city but prefer to live in nature. i'm a home body who loves to adventure.  you are fun, smart, and sexy. financially together, love to travel, great circle of friends. please be between 28-42 years old.\",\n",

       " 'online dating seems awkward and exciting to me in the same way that real world dating seemed in middle school. an exemplary story: one night in 8th grade while cruising the local mall with friends, i was approached by a guy my age who said his female friend with him (seated on the other side of the food court) thought i was \"hot.\" baffled why she would think this, and unsure what to believe or do, but not willing to lose face in front of my buddies, i pulled out a coupon book from my pocket, ripped out a really special one (15% off at \"vac & sew\"), and calmly instructed him, \"give her this. and tell her i think she\\'s cute.\" i\\'d like to think i\\'ve come a long way.  most things i say are tongue-in-cheek and i love to laugh out loud. my day is a success if i can use sarcasm and slapstick to delight the people around me. i crack jokes impulsively and mostly at inappropriate moments - when i try to hold them in, i still can\\'t help but crack up out loud anyway. as a result i\\'m often laughing alone - and that\\'s ok by me.  like everyone, i\\'m originally from somewhere else and appreciate this city more as a result. moved here from philly in january \\'10 and have been eagerly jumping at every chance to meet people, including this strange website. \"why the fuck am i on okcupid\" is a common question i ask myself, but i continue to find new answers.  i love to cook, camp, garden, and race bicycles. more generic interests include reading, film, and music.  i am an athlete but am not into sports. i am fiercely honest and absurdly loyal to my friends. i am very slow to judge people. i have a soft spot for board games and most campy games that make you feel like a kid. i mostly avoid watching tv because it\\'s too passive; i do appreciate its mind-numbing powers though.  i like to travel and have spent a decent amount of time in argentina, nicaragua, costa rica, and a bit of time in uruguay and brazil.  dating is great, but i\\'m genuinely happy to make friends too. i believe that compatible personalities and senses of humor are a good start to any relationship, but people need overlapping interests and activities to make it sustainable. i don\\'t give it up on the first date. just kidding, yes i do.',\n",

(i do hate the term casual encounters. sounds like we\\'re going for coffee and a donut. we can, though. speaking of which, i know a sweet place in the mission to get a shit ton of free donuts. more about that later.)  new friends: yes, i\\'m looking for new friends. i\\'m a very open and personal kind of guy, and i like my friends to feel close. i don\\'t believe in having emotionless friendship, and i like to be emotionally connected to my friends on some level. this does not mean that i want committed relationships from my friends or anything of the sort. i simply believe that if friends can\\'t trust each other with their emotions, they could just as well be strangers passing each other on the street. emotional connections are what i believe separate friends from acquaintances. friends empower each other-- they build each other up. occasionally, friends have issues. it happens. they get over it. needless to say, i don\\'t like sugar-coating life. oh, and don\\'t watch what ya say, tmi\\'s lost it\\'s authority around me. i don\\'t have much of a personal bubble, either. i\\'m just warning you long in advance. i do respect your bubble, though. :)  long term dating: how long is \\'long term\\' per se? weeks? months? years? honestly, if i\\'m still \\'dating\\' someone after six months and we haven\\'t moved to either a friend or relationship status, well, that\\'s probably the end of the \"long term dating\". i\\'m not the master of romance, but i am a romantic. i am on a dating site after all. if you\\'re looking to date purely for sex, i\\'d highly advise you look on my \\'sex partner\\' sections. ;) if you think you\\'ve got an interest, please send a message :). also, please, please, please, (really, please.) don\\'t confuse my asking to hang out as asking you on a date. also, don\\'t assume that because we hang out that we are dating. i also tend to lean rather heavily toward polyamory.  short term dating: this is pretty much the same thing as the above, so i\\'m not going to bother writing another block of \\'stuff\\'.  activity partners: i\\'m down to meet up and try anything, rock climbing, biking, swimming, drawing, whatever. just give me fair warning, eh? if you\\'ve got a moped i\\'d love to blast with you.  long distance pen pals: so what if you live a few states away? i love talking to people who generally want to befriend me. that said, if we\\'re going to talk, please be literate. this goes for anyone i talk to. while i might say things like, \"y hello thar,\" or ,\"teh fheck\\'s you doin\\'?\", that doesn\\'t mean i don\\'t like full, literate conversations. as you can see from reading this profile, (shit, you are still reading, aren\\'t you?) i like to be well spoken, and i can\\'t stand too much of, \"hey, wuts good? im chillin @ home wer r u?\" no offense to people to who text talk, but i just can\\'t stand to read it too long. a little bit\\'s okay, i just don\\'t want to have to decipher what the fuck you\\'re trying to say.  sex partners: before you make assumptions, just because i am also seeking sex partners does not mean i am only seeking sex partners. now, i said i hate the term \\'casual encounters\\' but that doesn\\'t mean i like \\'sex partners\\' either. i like to bundle this term loosely with \\'friends\\' because if i just plain don\\'t like someone i\\'m having sex with and that doesn\\'t change, i\\'m probably not going to have sex with that person much longer. i prefer that my partners are at least friends. now for my ever-present, \"this does not in any way, shape, form, or definition mean that we are dating or in a committed relationship.\" friends can have sex. in my opinion, there\\'s nothing wrong with experiencing pleasure with a friend. and... the \\'nitty gritty\\'. i am completely std free, and i am tested regularly. obviously, you should be too. condoms are a must. i definitely believe in \\'safe and sane\\' play, and i\\'d really prefer anyone who is seeking sex be capable of having open communication about it. ya know, stuff like what works, what doesn\\'t, boundaries, etc. while i like to say i\\'m experienced (i certainly think i am, and i\\'ve had no complaints), there is a lot that i haven\\'t tried, so creativity is a big plus. i\\'m willing to try almost anything. in case you can\\'t tell, i\\'m not a boy scout.  remember that part about tmi having lost authority?  as a general note, any time you\\'re uncomfortable or have something on your mind that you want to tell me, let me know. i\\'d rather you risk my feelings be hurt than disappear over something that could just be resolved in an adult fashion.  ***  other things i\\'m interested in  geminis: as you can see, i\\'m a gemini and very serious about it. what\\'s this mean? well, if you\\'ve ever read a personality profile for a gemini, it\\'s correct. both the good and the bad. now, geminis, what does this mean for you? i\\'m wary of you. oh, am i wary of you. no offense, but i know myself. (yeah, i know you\\'re giggling right now because you\\'re thinking of yourself and going, \"oooooooh.. teehee\" i\\'m onto your ass.) at the same time, i love you and embrace you with more open arms than possibly anyone else. if it\\'s a friendship you\\'re after, you got it, if it\\'s a date, sure, if it\\'s a relationship, i\\'m a little cautious, but you know exactly why, and if it\\'s sex, it\\'s probably gonna happen at the drop of a hat.  dragons (chinese zodiac): because of your likely brazen, bold, and firm nature, as well as my brazen, bold, and firm nature it\\'s a likelihood that we will argue and compete a lot. that\\'s not a bad thing though. it\\'s good to be able to defend a stance against someone you\\'re already friends with. strangers may not exchange the time of day, but friends can argue for hours and still be happy.  ***  a few other things  so, this section was an afterthought. here\\'s a few random things.  -stephen colbert is a man-like demigod.

       " 'to save you the trouble of reading the whole rambling summary, here\\'s the short list of my core beliefs, which may be more useful than all the other stuff:  *don\\'t panic. best advice i\\'ve ever been given. *there\\'s very little in life that should be taken seriously. i avoid taking myself seriously unless absolutely necessary. doubling down with a healthy dose of sarcasm also helps. *you should only call something \"impossible\" to make it that much more impressive when you eventually achieve it. nothing is impossible. *almost everything is better when it\\'s shared. *failure is preferable to not making the attempt at all, since you\\'ll probably learn something along the way. *i used to be unhappy with the stereotype that we nice guys finish last, until it occurred to me that nice guys *should* finish last--it\\'s just appropriate bedroom courtesy. *self-summary essays and emails do a terrible job of portraying personality. face-to-face communication is always best.  and now, a lot of text:  punctual. reckless. jock. photogenic. cheesemonger. not one of these words has ever been used to describe me. well, someone called me punctual once, but that was right after i arrived forty minutes late to a dinner party so it was probably sarcasm. probably.  words that *have* been used to describe me include: nerd, dreamer, hilarious, warm, modest, blasphemous, sweet, witty, rambler, silly, hungry, caring, distracted, awesome, ridiculous, geek, absurd, handsome (don\\'t act surprised--i photograph terribly), smart, annoying, talented, confusing, loving, and most frequently, dude.  i spent my late teens/early twenties working hard and skipping fun so that i wouldn\\'t have to later. now it\\'s later, and while i still have to work hard the time is right for some epic questing (what most of y\\'all call \"adventure\"). in addition to meeting new people and making more friends, i\\'m looking for a partner in crime, a watson to my holmes, a teller to my penn, a rose/martha/donna/amy to my doctor... you get the idea.  what i need is a fellow reluctant adventurer. why reluctant? well, sometimes it\\'s tempting to stay in and skip the action for a bit, especially when you\\'re cozy and there\\'s stuff you could cook at home and you\\'d have to get gas in the car first and damn it that\\'s no fun, so a fellow reluctant adventurer would understand that and be down for staying in for a board game/netflix browse/cuddle marathon. but equally important is the sudden, random desire to be out looking for trouble, so that\\'s an important quality, too. being at least a bit of a nerd--and having the glasses to match--is worth mucho bonus points.  i\\'ve done a bit of traveling and will soon do a whole bunch more. i love road trips, and will hopefully repeat my pilgrimage back to my hometown in indiana sometime soon.',\n",

       " \"i live in the east bay and worked for a local non-profit in a management position. like all nonprofits, i was overworked an under paid. now i work in social services. i love and feel strongly about the work i do. i enjoy listening to all kinds of music (but 80's is my favorite), going to movies or watching videos or dvds, survivor (yeah i know what can i say), plays, musicals, some museums, singing (but i'm terrible), long conversations about all things, including discussing feelings and the details of everyday life, walks or in my case rides through pretty places, car rides, watching an occasional baseball game when its really hot, playing cards, board games, weekends away when i have a traveling companion, celebrating holidays with family and friends. i also enjoy dining in (i find men who can cook sexy) or out, love, romance and intimacy, being goofy when it's appropriate, laughing and being with someone who can be silly with a good sense of humor.\",\n",
       " \"i'm a relatively recent transplant with a little over two years in the bay area after growing up in kentucky, going to school in virginia, and working in pittsburgh and dc. i love it here but i still have a lot more exploring to do. i live in oakland and work in san francisco and truly love both cities. i'm constantly amazed the massive physical beauty and the minute cultural eccentricities of the bay area, but i'm still not sure if that's going to keep me here forever. i like new things a lot. i also like reading, writing, live sporting events, museums, politics, bourbon, going to the gym or jogging, parks, pub trivia, long conversations, social justice, swimming in natural water, and exploring.\",\n",
       " \"my three siblings and i were raised by my mom who might possibly have been the most amazing kindergarten teacher ever. i know in some areas we were left wanting but never where it mattered most. my mother taught me to believe in my dreams and the power of my imagination, to always be hopeful, to help others, and to show gratitude where it is due. today i'm a forward thinking idealist w/ a touch of realist mixed in. in my world things like integrity, ethics, & the golden rule rules supreme & the last place i ever want to be is on a high horse. i'm easy going, open minded, kind, & while i am fairly grounded, i can also be rather silly at times. it's part of my boyish charm ;)  as for things i enjoy, i love going on day trips or staycations, driving w/ the windows down & music up, laughing till my side hurts, reading, theater, live bands, stargazing in a field or up-close & personal at an observatory, photography, museums, constructive forms of expression in general, cozy beds w/ lots of pillows, exploring, hiking, picnics in unlikely places, people watching on public transportation, dive bars, dance clubs, lazy sundays, looking up fun facts on the web, & yes, run-on sentences. and if, by chance, i have not yet tried something that you think i must, i would appreciate it if you would aid me in correcting my misguided ways. regardless, in any act, the secret to making anything fun is having other people to share it with.\"]"

(that's right. yoga winds me up. go figure.)  mentally, i'm an insightful linguist. i tend to improv on the fly with my job (i'm a teacher of the visually impaired/ orientation and mobility specialist) and have the gift of gab. i have book and writing smarts, but find that math is a challenge even though i slogged my way through calculus.  emotionally, i've been through some nasty hard knocks at an early age. as a result, i'm tough as nails, but considerately more kind, empathetic and compassionate than the average jane. i'm definitely a day dreamer of sorts and try to be the peacemaker, but if you try crossing the line too much, i will let you know.  spiritually, i believe in jesus as the messiah, but don't force my beliefs down other people's throats. once you've had agape love, you can never go back ;-) even though my relationship with yhwh is really important to me, i get really restless in most churches, at least in the usa. i love the way the jewish believers hold the torah sacred. i think prayers sound better in hebrew. call it my jewish side..\",\n",
