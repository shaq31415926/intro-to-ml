       "development of new abilities and the advancement of existing ones is my strongest drive in life, which defines a very large part of who i am. my passions are numerous and through their natural ebb and flow of motivation i find myself almost constantly enthralled by some wonderful skill to pursue, some carefully planned object(s) to create, or endlessly enjoyable research to assist either cause.  because of this, finding fun exciting people to share things, do things, teach things, learn things, and enjoy things with is rather high on my priorities list.  as for some things i'm into:  i've done parkour for 5+ years, and would have to credit the discipline as being possibly the most important and enjoyable in my life. if you ever feel the interest, i'd be more than happy to give you a 10 minute lesson that could very well change the way you look at and interact with the world  beyond parkour, i like to explore the physical world in every way i possibly can. i rock climb (quite a bit), skimboard, surf, play paintball,rock climb, do partner acrobatics, bike, ride a unicycle (trials), climb trees, hike, backpack, ski, and dance like a fiend to drum&bass.  when i've satisfied my physical spirit or it's too dark out for the above activities i sew(a lot), juggle, do photography, model, play backgammon, tie knots, and dabble in endless underdeveloped skills required for creating the many different things i love to create. i also love playing magic and board games (ricochet robots and jungle speed are my two favorite games ever, small world is quite good as well)    1\n",
