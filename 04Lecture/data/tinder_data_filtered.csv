she is also a teacher and could have hardly imagined where their lives would take them. soon thereafter the dictatorship interfered in the university and through no fault of their own, my parents had to leave and went to an island city far away which is where i, their only child, was born and raised. it might also explain how i grew up as the only person with my ethnic and cultural mix that i knew of, of how i have three native tongues and can speak a few other accents and languages, and hold three citizenships today.  my parents, who still live in brazil, gifted me with a happy childhood despite the turbulence we went through  rough times during hyperinflation, moving to another small city on the other side of the globe and then back, a shattered family when our car fell off from a 200-feet cliff, witnessing the return of democracy, winning the one scholarship to an elite high school in the capital, opening one door after another, and then embarking on my own immigrant journey to come to the us for college. learning is the music of my soul; i loved everything and focused on engineering, medicine and business across three amazing schools. after spending several years creating companies and products, at the moment i work on investing in other people's ideas in the heart of silicon valley. i know how blessed i am and i consecrate my waking hours to, in some small way, making a dent in the universe.  i believe in a sound body and a sound mind. my legs have climbed the tallest mountain in africa;

[grammar:on]  i'll break from the lists now. i'm pretty easygoing. i'm a believer in letting people live their lives without adding to their own mile-high plates of shit. after all, we live in the same, little world.  i like people. yeah, that's a broad phrase. i like to think about the way people think, to put it in a roundabout way, i suppose. it's interesting the way we act, interact, and go about life.  i also happen to like sex. let's get our giggles out. i will, however, be safe and say prudes need not apply. i'm also an active kinkster. turn off? buh bye. :]  still with me? good.  oh right! i'm a bit of a fucking geek. i also like to exercise my right to expletives. fuck. (okay, maybe that was uncalled for. maybe.) i'm (very) occasionally known to replace my entire vocabulary with four letter words, sometimes for minutes on end. this usually follows a heated, and often hilarious rant. i didn't realize how much i actually swore 'till someone pointed it out to me. the most appropriate response at the time i could come up with was, ""well, fuck, dude."" that said, i'm capable of keeping a clean mouth at least 8 hours out of the day, and around children. no holds barred after 9pm, though.  my profile currently indicates that i'm 'straight', but if labels are required, i'd fit the title of 'heteroflexible' a bit closer. okay, maybe 'hetero(very)flexible'. i'll warn ya straight up as well-- i'm not a manly man oozing testosterone, and i damn well plan to keep it that way. if you're looking for an 'all-american image of man' i'm not your guy. oh, and for the love of mike, don't try to change me. if i feel the need or urge to change, it'll happen. just remember, i'm not your toy, mmkay? mmkay.  so, what am i looking for? before you get into all this stuff, i'm mainly looking to increase my friend base. i need more people to chill and game with. i don't care what you're playing. i might even play d&d 4th, if i have to. if i -have- to. it'd also be cool to meet more nightlifey people. i spent three years working and going to school, instead of exploring like i should have been. :x i need nighttime escapes! know of any good bars or shows? tell me! drag me! force me! quietly suggest! anything! (especially if they need workers :p) if you know about any raves going on in the bay area (bonus points if you can supply a ride? :p) poke at me.  well, if you made it this far, by all means, keep going. odds are, i'll probably like ya. anyways, as you can see from my sidebar, i'm looking for new friends, long-term and short-term dating, activity partners, long distance pen pals, and sex partners. (i do hate the term casual encounters. sounds like we're going for coffee and a donut. we can, though. speaking of which, i know a sweet place in the mission to get a shit ton of free donuts. more about that later.)  new friends: yes, i'm looking for new friends. i'm a very open and personal kind of guy, and i like my friends to feel close. i don't believe in having emotionless friendship, and i like to be emotionally connected to my friends on some level. this does not mean that i want committed relationships from my friends or anything of the sort. i simply believe that if friends can't trust each other with their emotions, they could just as well be strangers passing each other on the street. emotional connections are what i believe separate friends from acquaintances. friends empower each other-- they build each other up. occasionally, friends have issues. it happens. they get over it. needless to say, i don't like sugar-coating life. oh, and don't watch what ya say, tmi's lost it's authority around me. i don't have much of a personal bubble, either. i'm just warning you long in advance. i do respect your bubble, though. :)  long term dating: how long is 'long term' per se? weeks? months? years? honestly, if i'm still 'dating' someone after six months and we haven't moved to either a friend or relationship status, well, that's probably the end of the ""long term dating"". i'm not the master of romance, but i am a romantic. i am on a dating site after all. if you're looking to date purely for sex, i'd highly advise you look on my 'sex partner' sections. ;) if you think you've got an interest, please send a message :). also, please, please, please, (really, please.) don't confuse my asking to hang out as asking you on a date. also, don't assume that because we hang out that we are dating. i also tend to lean rather heavily toward polyamory.  short term dating: this is pretty much the same thing as the above, so i'm not going to bother writing another block of 'stuff'.  activity partners: i'm down to meet up and try anything, rock climbing, biking, swimming, drawing, whatever. just give me fair warning, eh? if you've got a moped i'd love to blast with you.  long distance pen pals: so what if you live a few states away? i love talking to people who generally want to befriend me. that said, if we're going to talk, please be literate. this goes for anyone i talk to. while i might say things like, ""y hello thar,"" or ,""teh fheck's you doin'?"", that doesn't mean i don't like full, literate conversations. as you can see from reading this profile, (shit, you are still reading, aren't you?) i like to be well spoken, and i can't stand too much of, ""hey, wuts good? im chillin @ home wer r u?"" no offense to people to who text talk, but i just can't stand to read it too long. a little bit's okay, i just don't want to have to decipher what the fuck you're trying to say.  sex partners: before you make assumptions, just because i am also seeking sex partners does not mean i am only seeking sex partners. now, i said i hate the term 'casual encounters' but that doesn't mean i like 'sex partners' either. i like to bundle this term loosely with 'friends' because if i just plain don't like someone i'm having sex with and that doesn't change, i'm probably not going to have sex with that person much longer. i prefer that my partners are at least friends. now for my ever-present, ""this does not in any way, shape, form, or definition mean that we are dating or in a committed relationship."" friends can have sex. in my opinion, there's nothing wrong with experiencing pleasure with a friend. and... the 'nitty gritty'. i am completely std free, and i am tested regularly. obviously, you should be too. condoms are a must. i definitely believe in 'safe and sane' play, and i'd really prefer anyone who is seeking sex be capable of having open communication about it. ya know, stuff like what works, what doesn't, boundaries, etc. while i like to say i'm experienced (i certainly think i am, and i've had no complaints), there is a lot that i haven't tried, so creativity is a big plus. i'm willing to try almost anything. in case you can't tell, i'm not a boy scout.  remember that part about tmi having lost authority?  as a general note, any time you're uncomfortable or have something on your mind that you want to tell me, let me know. i'd rather you risk my feelings be hurt than disappear over something that could just be resolved in an adult fashion.  ***  other things i'm interested in  geminis: as you can see, i'm a gemini and very serious about it. what's this mean? well, if you've ever read a personality profile for a gemini, it's correct. both the good and the bad. now, geminis, what does this mean for you? i'm wary of you. oh, am i wary of you. no offense, but i know myself. (yeah, i know you're giggling right now because you're thinking of yourself and going, ""oooooooh.. teehee"" i'm onto your ass.) at the same time, i love you and embrace you with more open arms than possibly anyone else. if it's a friendship you're after, you got it, if it's a date, sure, if it's a relationship, i'm a little cautious, but you know exactly why, and if it's sex, it's probably gonna happen at the drop of a hat.  dragons (chinese zodiac): because of your likely brazen, bold, and firm nature, as well as my brazen, bold, and firm nature it's a likelihood that we will argue and compete a lot. that's not a bad thing though. it's good to be able to defend a stance against someone you're already friends with. strangers may not exchange the time of day, but friends can argue for hours and still be happy.  ***  a few other things  so, this section was an afterthought. here's a few random things.  -stephen colbert is a man-like demigod. (among men)  -i'd be a capoeirista if i stopped being so damned lazy.  -i'd be a tracuer if i started running again.  -i really want a purp bong.  -i'd make my own clothes if i still had a sewing machine and all the supplies i needed.  -i'm easier to understand with a fake, generic british or irish accent. either is 10x better with a cigarette in my mouth.  -my hometown is monrovia, california. i don't plan on going back for more than a weekend at a time.  -i feel like my profile seems extra serious. :x  so, you're still reading. i am impressed. if i've noticed you're reading my

approach life as an exploration- i am both the experimenter and the experimented on and my life is the laboratory. the world is both my playground, my classroom and my responsibility and i seek someone who feels likewise.  i am a lot of things- and i often contradict myself and i would like to be appreciated for all my multiplicities- the dark and the light, the sweet and the tart, the pretty and the ugly. i have many aspects and like to give them all stage time- depending upon the situation, person/s and my frame of mind. complexity is a state and simplification is a goal i both accept and subscribe to- in the mean time, i want to be fully held and seen- and occasionally swept off my feet preferably for a piggy back up a hill ;0  i flex flow between ferocious directness and ridiculous shyness and both are equal expressions of me. i like to cook and really like to feed others. in providing nourishment, i am fed. i love kung fu and qi gong and am dedicated to my practice- would like to be more so- this translates into a preference for action movies with well choreographed fight scenes. i am just as moved by the visceral poetry of destructive prowess as by the beauty of the words of rumi. i need deep conversations but really appreciate random moments of idiocy and shallow interludes. i believe any dialogue should a be a symphony of both levity and gravity.  i have a love/hate relationship with integral theory (it would be nice to be able to commiserate with someone on this) and a love- love relationship with the foundation for spiritual development (ask me what this is and i will stumble through a befuddled explanation). i fluctuate between feeling too school for cool and too cool for school. the fried potato is my weakness- i love it in alls its variations and have been known to devour an entire bag on the way home from an intense work out- true story. i still occasionally fall off the potato chip wagon and enjoy it every time.  i am accommodating and pretty easy going until i am not. i am softer than i act and probably harder than i look. i thrive on the tension in between being and becoming and desire an ingenious cocktail of challenge and support from friends as well as potential partners. i am neither alpha nor beta and as a self positioned fringe member of the pack, i know when to and am comfortable with following/supporting as well as taking charge but i have not yet learned how to dance nicely with others- i guess i am here to practice.  in summation: enneagram dominant 9w8 sx/so/sp, intp, aries, metal monkey, pitta vatta,
